# Obstacle-Avoiding-Vehicle
An arduino based obstacle avoiding vehicle that is capable of moving in all the directions
this vehicle contains an sensor through which the readings are taken and sent to aurdino.
the sensors helps the car to detect the objects around it and stop before hitting them.
this would be helpful if it can implemented in this generation cars.
we would be able to control the number of accidents happening and bring their number down.
